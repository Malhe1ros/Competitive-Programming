Euler tour properties:

1. beg[u] to en[u] is the subtree of u;

2. from 0 to beg[u], the elements which only beg[x] appear, are in the path from u to the root;

3. from en[a] to beg[b] (en[a]<beg[b]) the elements which appear only once (only beg[x] or en[x] appear), are in the path from a to b (LCA not included);
