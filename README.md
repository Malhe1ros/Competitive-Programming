# Competitive-Programming
Algorithms and data structures for competitive programming

I am trying to make this lib more "other-friendly" adding "How to use" documentations as some of the algorithms and data structures only i (or past i) knows what is going on the code;

Feel free to take and use whatever you want;

# Algorithms:
chtdeque.cpp = Convex hull trick for dynamic programming when functions and queries are in sorted order in O(n);
convex_hull.cpp = Returns the convex hull of the points in O(n\*logn) [working but i will update]
